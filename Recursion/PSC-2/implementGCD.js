Implement GCD
Description
Implement the GCD function using recursion. Given two integers 
𝑎
 and 
𝑏
, find the greatest common divisor of 
𝑎
 and 
𝑏
. The approach which uses logarithmic time complexity is expected here.

Input Description
The first line of the input contains one integer 
𝑡
 (
1
≤
𝑡
≤
10
) — the number of test cases. Then 
𝑡
 test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers 
𝑎
 and 
𝑏
 (
1
≤
𝑎
,
𝑏
≤
1000000000
).

Output Description
For each test case, print the answer: GCD of the two numbers.
